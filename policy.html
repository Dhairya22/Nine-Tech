                  <p>Throughout the website, we may refer to ‘personal information’. ’Personal information’ is any information or opinion (regardless of its accuracy) which identifies you, or which is capable of identifying you.</p>

                  <h4 class="mt-3">What personal information do we collect and hold?</h4>
                  <p>We only collect personal information that is necessary for our business activities or for a purpose outlined in this Privacy Policy or otherwise disclosed to you.

                   <br> The type of personal information we collect depends on the type of dealing you have with us and may include:</p>
                   <div class="demo">
                   <ul>
                       <li>your name, gender, date of birth, phone number, postal or delivery address and email address;</li>
                       <li>information about the products or services you order or enquire about, including how the products or services are used;</li>
                       <li>your financial information (such as credit card and bank account details), method of payment and any additional information required for user authentication processes; and</li>
                       <li>any other information relating to you, including the information you provide by email or telephone, or through surveys, competitions, promotions, questionnaires or other promotional activities.</li>
                   </ul>
                </div>
                <p>We do not collect your sensitive information (as defined by the Privacy Act). If you have accidentally provided us with your sensitive information, please contact us so it can be deleted

                   <br> <br> Furthermore, we may collect non-personal information about you when you visit our website (i.e. the time, date and duration of your browsing session). This data does not include anything pertaining to your identity, and is simply used to maintain the functionality and ease-of-use of this site. We only collect personal information as permitted by the Privacy Act.
                    
                   <br> <br> You do not have to provide us with your personal information. However, not doing so may limit the functionality of our website or prevent us from completing the purpose for which we have requested the information, such as to provide you with our products or services.</p>
                  
                   <h4 class="mt-3">How do we collect personal information?</h4>
                   <p class="mt-3 col-12" style="padding-left: 0%;">We collect personal information in several ways, including:</p>
                   <div class="demo">
                    <ul>
                        <li>through your use or orders of our products or services;</li>
                        <li>when you visit our website or submit information through the website or contact us (in person, by phone or email, or via the website);</li>
                        <li>when you provide information through our surveys, competitions, promotions, questionnaires or other promotional activities; and</li>
                        <li>from publicly available sources of information.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </div>
                 <p>The personal information we collect will track and enhance your use of our website or our products or services and assist us in providing a better service to you.

                    <br> <br> When we collect personal information directly from you, we will take reasonable steps to notify you (using a collection notice) at, before, or as soon as practicable after, the time of collection. As a collection notice is specific to a particular collection of personal information, it will provide more specific information about our information-handling practices than this policy.
                    
                    <br> <br> This Privacy Policy is subject to any specific provisions contained in our collection notices.
                    
                    <br> <br> If you provide us with personal information about another individual (as their authorised representative), we rely on you to:</p>
                    <div class="demo">
                        <ul>
                            <li>inform them that you are providing their personal information to us; and</li>
                            <li>advise them that they can contact us for more information.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                     <p>You must take reasonable steps to ensure the individual is aware of, and consents to, the matters in this Privacy Policy. You must also assist us with any requests by the individual to access or update the personal information you have collected from them and provided to us.

                        <br> <br> We may also collect your personal information from third parties and organisations engaged by us to carry out some of our business functions.</p>
